# TensorLink

TensorLink is a decentralized platform designed to scale neural network training and inference in PyTorch by arbitrarily distributing models across a network of peers. With TensorLink, users can efficiently train and execute large models, harnessing the combined computational power of distributed nodes.

## Key Features:

- **Model wrapping:** tensorlink acts as a transparent layer over your existing models, enabling distributed computing without altering the underlying codebase. This allows for easy integration while preserving the integrity of your original ML models.

- **Model Distribution:** Leveraging pipeline and data parallelism, tensorlink effectively scales the training of larger models and addresses common inefficiencies associated with internet-based distributed learning systems.
  
- **Data Privacy and Security:** tensorlink offers workflows which prioritize the protection of sensitive information using data obfuscation and model fragmentation techniques.

- **Consensus:** tensorlink utilizes an innovative proof-of-learning protocol, supported by collateralized nodes and a robust reputation system. This framework validates the accuracy and integrity of distributed learning activities, ensuring transparent and secure operations across the network.
