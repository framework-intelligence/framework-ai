# Tensorlink

Tensorlink is a peer-to-peer platform for scaling neural network training in PyTorch. Our goal is to reduce the economic and technical barriers to distributed training, and improve access to large state-of-the-art models.

Tensorlink acts as a wrapper over your existing models, enabling distributed computing without altering the underlying codebase. This allows for easy integration while preserving the integrity of your original ML models and training workflows. 

Leveraging a network of incentivized workers, automated model parsing, and pipeline parallelism, we can effectively scale the training of larger models over the internet.
  
## Security 

Tensorlink utilizes an innovative proof-of-learning protocol, supported by collateralized validator nodes, and a robust reputation system. This framework validates the accuracy and integrity of distributed learning activities, ensuring transparent and secure operations across the network. Furthermore, model parsing fragments the structure of your model across the network, preventing any one entity from having your entire model. This also allows the obfuscation of your training data by loading the first few layers on the user's device.
