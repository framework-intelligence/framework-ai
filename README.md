# TensorLink

TensorLink is a decentralized platform designed to scale neural network training and inference by distributing models across a network of peers. With TensorLink, users can efficiently train and execute large models, harnessing the combined computational power of distributed nodes.

## Description

TensorLink addresses the growing demand for computational resources required by large-scale neural network models, such as those used in natural language processing and computer vision tasks. By leveraging a decentralized network of peers, TensorLink offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for training and executing deep learning models.

Key features of TensorLink include:

- **Decentralized Model Distribution:** TensorLink distributes model parameters across multiple nodes in a decentralized manner, allowing for parallel training and inference.
  
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** By tapping into the idle compute power of network participants, TensorLink optimizes resource utilization and reduces training times for large-scale models.

- **Data Privacy and Security:** TensorLink provides mechanisms for obfuscating model parameters and input data, ensuring privacy and security for sensitive information.

- **Proof of Learning Consensus:** Through a novel proof-of-learning consensus mechanism, TensorLink ensures the integrity and accuracy of distributed learning processes, enhancing transparency and reliability.
